![Expense Tracker](https://i.ibb.co/Njh09Zz/jeb-kharchi.jpg)


#### I'm targeting an issue faced by individuals in the modern age. 

The proposed solution is a system that helps users track their spending according to the customized categories and shows the users spending in a visual format which will help the individual re-evaluate their life choices regarding money.


### Built using  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           - HTML5  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           - CSS3  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           - ReactJS  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           - JavaScript   

### Working:
It throws a form ans asks the user to input their spending either in the form of text or speech.  
Once the user has filled, it automatically draws a pie pie to display this INCOME v/s EXPENSE.
Graphical Comparison gives him/her an idea to keep track and reduce unwanted spending.


It allows the user to comapre their spending 
Takes the speech/text as the input and allows user to compare
their spendings(shows Graphical Representation).


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
