## I'm targeting an issue faced by individuals in the modern age  

The proposed solution is a system that helps users track their spending according to the customized categories and shows the users spending in a visual format which will help the individual re-evaluate their life choices regarding money.

 
## Working:
1. It throws a form ans asks the user to input their spending either in the form of text or speech.  
2. Once the user has filled, it automatically draws a pie pie to display this INCOME v/s EXPENSE.
3. Graphical Comparison gives him/her an idea to keep track and reduce unwanted spending.
